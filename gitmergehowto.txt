How to merge your feature branch with master and push to a remote repository:

When working on a branch that contains changes the master does not have:
	1. Push your feature branch to github (i.e. git push origin <yourbranchname>)
	2. Checkout your local master branch (i.e. git checkout master)
	3. Ensure your master branch is current with the remote master:
		a. do a "git pull origin master". This will merge the master from github to your master.
	4. Merge your remote branch (the one you just pushed) with your local master (i.e. git pull origin <yourbranchname>) 
	5. If there were no merge conflicts, skip to step 8
	6. If there were merge conflicts, resolve them with a "git mergetool" command. 
	7. After the mergetool exits, resolve the merge with "git merge --continue"
	8. Your master now contains the changes from your feature branch. Push your (now updated) master to github w "git push origin master"
